Hello world!

This is Lisa! I am a digital marketer who is pursing a Master's in Library and Information Science from the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I am exploring GitHub as part of my final project for my intro programming class using Python. I am very excited to see how this goes! I've used GitHub previously, but had a lot of hand holding. I'm excited to explore this tool all by myself.
